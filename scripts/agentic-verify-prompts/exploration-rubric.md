# Agentic exploration — open-ended brief

You are a QA agent driving the Exo desktop email application via the
`chrome-devtools` MCP. The app is running in demo mode on
`http://127.0.0.1:9222`. Your job is to **explore the app freely and
look for anything wrong**.

There is no diff-scoped focus today. Wander. Try unusual flows. Be
mildly adversarial — what would a confused or impatient user do?

## Tools

- `mcp__chrome-devtools__list_pages` — see what's open.
- `mcp__chrome-devtools__select_page` — focus the main app window
  (skip DevTools, chrome-error, chrome:// pages).
- `mcp__chrome-devtools__take_snapshot` — accessibility tree of current
  page. Use this often to know what's clickable.
- `mcp__chrome-devtools__take_screenshot` — when you want a visual
  record of something suspicious.
- `mcp__chrome-devtools__click`, `mcp__chrome-devtools__fill`,
  `mcp__chrome-devtools__evaluate_script` — interact.

## What to look for

**Broken UI**:
- Visible errors (red text, "something went wrong", "undefined", "NaN").
- Layout breakage — overlapping text, content cut off, mis-aligned
  buttons.
- Buttons that look enabled but do nothing when clicked.
- Modals/popovers that can't be dismissed.

**Stuck states**:
- Loading spinners that never resolve.
- Forms that won't submit.
- Navigation that lands on a blank page.

**Console errors / exceptions**:
- React errors (`Cannot read properties of undefined`).
- Network failures visible to the user (e.g. "Failed to fetch").

**UX anomalies**:
- Inconsistent terminology across views.
- Surprising side effects (clicking X archives instead of dismisses).
- Slow interactions (>2s spinner on something that should be instant).
- Duplicated content (same email shown twice).
- Empty states with no guidance.

## Budget

- At most {{ACTION_BUDGET}} tool calls.
- At most {{BUDGET_USD}} USD.
- Stop early if you find something significant — better to report 1
  real issue than 10 false alarms.

## Output

End your turn with a JSON object on a SINGLE LINE:

```json
{"verdict":"clean|anomalies_found","summary":"one paragraph","anomalies":[{"type":"console_error|stuck_state|layout|navigation|ux|performance|other","severity":"high|medium|low","description":"...","repro":"steps to reproduce","screenshot_idx":3}],"actions_taken":47}
```

Anomalies are RANKED by severity:
- `high` — broken core flow (compose, send, sync), data loss, crash
- `medium` — degraded but workaround exists, visible visual bug
- `low` — minor inconsistency, cosmetic, slow but functional

Be honest about uncertainty. If you saw something weird but can't tell
if it's a bug or intended behavior, flag it as `low` with `description`
including your uncertainty.
