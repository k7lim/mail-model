/**
 * LLM-as-judge scorer for AI-feature evals.
 *
 * Grades a feature's output against a per-fixture markdown rubric using
 * Claude Sonnet, returning an integer 0-10 score and a free-text reason.
 *
 * Goes through AnthropicService.createMessage() — DO NOT instantiate
 * the SDK directly. The service handles retries with exponential
 * backoff on rate limits / server errors, and records every call to
 * the llm_calls table with caller="eval-judge:<fixtureId>" so judge
 * spend can be correlated back to specific fixtures.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *   - Judge API throws, returns no text block, or returns unparseable
 *     JSON → return score 0 with `judgeError` set. The runner treats
 *     this distinct from a real score: no regression-delta check, and
 *     reports it separately so a Claude 5xx or parser bug doesn't
 *     masquerade as a model regression. (See #129 — a midpoint
 *     fallback score of 5 looked like a regression for any fixture
 *     baselined above 8.)
 *
 * Calibration is DEFERRED — see TODOS.md. Risk: judge might silently
 * mis-score for the first month. Mitigation is spot-checking the
 * traces in the report until we have a calibration suite.
